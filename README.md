# wp-excellent

My current starter theme for WordPress is called _excellent_, not because I consider it to be excellent ðŸ™ƒ, but because it is based on the workflow suggested by Andy Bell's https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/.

## Editor workflow

...

## Using this

### Install dependencies

```
- npm install
- composer install
```

### Working locally

Creates a dev server (browser-sync) with hot reload on localhost:3000, pointing to the domain created by local by flywheel. Must be edited in package.json.

```
npm start
```

### Creating a production build

Minify JS and CSS.

```
npm run production
```

**Andy Bell**
His CSS methodology and ideas in gerneal make sense to me. He recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology.
